# CLI for Documentation
This was meant as a prototype.

I wanted to see what it's like to browse Reference Documentation.
I liked the idea, I still like it, but when I published it, there was
no interest, so I abandoned it. Maybe I should have kept trying.

# Converter
I used the code in the `converter` dir to ... convert the documentation
of the specific Elm packages to the format I used in my app. I didn't clean
it at all, that's why it looks the way it does.
